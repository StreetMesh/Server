/**
 * What turns a Laravel application into a StreetMesh server.
 *
 * Three things arrive together and are registered in one order, deliberately.
 * The **protocol** is what everything else stands on: identity, records, blobs,
 * permission. A **domicile** is where people live. A **venue** is where they
 * gather. A server may offer either of the last two, both, or neither.
 *
 * This was three packages and three providers, and the order they booted in was
 * whatever Composer's resolution happened to produce. The code worked around
 * that in several places — asking `offers()` rather than `has()`, deferring a
 * config write to `boot` — and those workarounds were load-bearing precisely
 * because nothing pinned the order. Now something does. The workarounds stay
 * anyway, and each one says below why it is still right for a different reason
 * than the one it was written for.
