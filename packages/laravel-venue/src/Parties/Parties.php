 * here, and it is durable — the hub holds who is connected this second and
 * forgets it, which is no use for answering whether somebody who reloaded is
 * still in the party.
 *
 * Nothing here asks an experience anything. Parties are on or off for the whole
 * venue, by the operator's hand, and the reason is that the operator is the only
 * party who knows what is installed. An experience author cannot know which
 * venue their package lands in; an operator can read their own configuration.
 *
 * The cost of that is real and is the operator's to carry: a venue with parties
 * on and a competitive experience installed has given its players a private
 * voice channel their opponents cannot hear. `Readiness` says so out loud at
 * boot, and then it is their call.
