 * Somebody's place in a party.

 * is: a visitor is only ever here on borrowed authority, and when that is
 * withdrawn their place in the party goes with it. Somebody who leaves the
 * venue leaves the party, and nothing has to notice separately.
 *
 * Where they are right now is deliberately not here. That changes every time
 * somebody walks through a door and is worth nothing a second later, so it
 * lives in the party's room with the rest of the hot-path state — this is only
 * the record that they are in the party at all.
