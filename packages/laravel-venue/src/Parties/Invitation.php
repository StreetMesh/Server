 * open door, no code to type and nothing to browse: somebody already inside
 * points at a name they can see in the room they are in, and that person says
 * yes or no.
 *
 * Addressed to a DID rather than to a delegation on purpose. An invitation is
 * offered and answered minutes apart, and a reload in between mints the invitee
 * a fresh permission — an invitation pinned to the old one would quietly
 * address nobody, which is the same bug seats were keyed into once already.
