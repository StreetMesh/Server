 * answers: who this visitor is, whether they belong at this gathering, and in
 * which seat. None of that is taken from the request — the seat comes from the
 * one this venue put them in, so asking for a different one gets the one they
 * actually have.
 *
 * The hub's address comes back with it, because a browser has no other way to
 * learn it and hard-coding it into a page would mean an operator could not move
 * their realtime half without editing an experience's templates.
