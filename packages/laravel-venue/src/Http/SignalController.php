/**
 * Carrying the few notes that let two browsers in a party find each other.
 *
 * Ordinary HTTP, deliberately. This is not gameplay and it is not hot: an offer,
 * an answer, a handful of addresses, and then it is over for good — after which
 * the audio and video go directly between the two browsers and nothing arrives
 * here at all.
 *
 * Being in the party is the whole of the access control, checked on both verbs.
 * A party is private by construction, so anybody who is not in one has no
 * business either reading what is waiting in it or leaving anything there.
 *
 * It carries who is here as well, on the same request. That is not thrift for
 * its own sake: presence and notes arriving together is what stops a note ever
 * being early — there is no moment when an offer has landed from somebody this
 * browser has not been told about yet.
 *
 * Polled rather than pushed, which is what it should stop being. The server this
 * runs on has Reverb configured, and the cost of asking grows with the number of
 * people in the party — see the note in `decisions/parties.md`.
