/**
 * What the hub tells this venue.
 *
 * The only direction between the two that is not one-way. A ticket is signed
 * here and merely verified there; a result can be asked for. This is the hub
 * speaking unprompted, and it has to, because the two things worth knowing
 * happen when nobody is looking: the last person leaving a table, and a game
 * ending after both players have closed their tabs.
 *
 * A hub holds no key of its own, so it is recognised by a shared secret. That
 * is the whole of the trust here, and it is worth being plain about what it
 * buys: this venue believes the room state and the result of a gathering it
 * opened. It does not believe anything about who somebody is — that came from
 * a ticket this venue signed, and it does not come back through here.
