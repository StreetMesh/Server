/**
 * The three documents the comms widget is made of.
 *
 * Each is a whole page served into an iframe of its own, which is the shape
 * rather than an implementation detail. A venue's screens belong to whoever
 * wrote the experience: the badge has to sit above all of them without
 * inheriting a stacking context or a stylesheet it did not ask for, and the
 * stage has to hold live media that a re-render of somebody's game cannot take
 * away. Both of those are what a separate document buys.
 *
 * They are also deliberately dumb about each other. Nothing here knows the
 * badge is next to the stage or that the panel opens above it — the host
 * document arranges them and carries messages between them, because it is the
 * only party that can see all three.

     * there is usually a proxy, and a proxy with security headers switched on
     * sends `X-Frame-Options: deny` over everything it serves. That is a
     * sensible default for a site made of pages and fatal to one made of

     * come back 200 and none of them is allowed to appear.
     *
     * Both headers, because they are read by different browsers and one of them
     * we cannot win. `X-Frame-Options` is what an old browser understands, and
     * it is also the one a proxy is likely to overwrite. `frame-ancestors`
     * supersedes it wherever it is understood — a browser seeing both applies
     * this and ignores that — which is what makes this work even when the
     * proxy's `deny` arrives alongside it and we have no way to stop it.
     *
     * `'self'` and not a list. A venue frames its own comms and nobody else's
     * business is served here, so there is nothing to allow that is not already
     * this origin.
