 * A venue that does not do parties has nowhere to do them.
 *
 * Switched off means gone rather than hidden, which is the rule the venue
 * capability itself follows — a server that is not a venue has no door to one,
 * and a venue with parties off has no party to knock at.
 *
 * Asked per request rather than when routes are registered. A setting consulted
 * at boot gets baked into a cached route table, and the symptom is an operator
 * turning parties on and nothing whatsoever happening until somebody thinks to
 * clear a cache.
