/**
 * Whether what is on is anybody's business.
 *
 * A venue decides. A chess club posts its programme on the door; a private
 * members' club does not, and neither is more correct than the other.
 *
 * Asked per request rather than when routes are registered, and that is not a
 * detail: a setting consulted at boot gets baked into a cached route table, so
 * changing it would appear to do nothing until somebody remembered to clear the
 * cache. A setting that silently fails to take effect is worse than one that
 * does not exist.
 *
 * Either way the experiences themselves stay behind the door. Seeing that chess
 * is on offer is not the same as sitting down at a table.
