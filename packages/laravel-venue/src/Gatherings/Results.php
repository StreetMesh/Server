 * Asking the hub how something ended.

 * sentence that passes between them. The hub decided what happened; only the
 * venue can sign it into anybody's records, because only the venue holds a key.
 *
 * Asked rather than announced, and the direction matters. A hub that pushed
 * results would be a hub the venue had to authenticate, and the hub holds no
 * credential to authenticate with — it verifies what the venue signed and signs
 * nothing itself. Asking keeps the trust one-way, exactly as the ticket does in
 * the other direction.
 *
 * What a browser can do is say "look now". It cannot say what happened: the
 * answer comes from here, and a game that is not over answers nothing.
