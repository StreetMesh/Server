 * a hub telling a venue something has to be a hub the venue can recognise, and
 * a hub holds no key of its own.
 *
 * So: a shared secret, and the venue refuses to run without one. A venue that
 * started anyway would look healthy and quietly never hear that a game had
 * ended.
 *
 * Read from configuration today and deliberately behind a class, because where
 * it comes from is going to change. An operator will eventually set and rotate
 * this from a screen rather than a deploy, and everything that asks for it
 * should not have to care.
