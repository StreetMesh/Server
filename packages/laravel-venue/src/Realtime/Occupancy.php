 * current at the moment it changes; and anything not already known is fetched,
 * which covers a venue that has only just started or a hub that has only just
 * restarted.
 *
 * The lifetime is a backstop rather than the mechanism. If announcements are
 * arriving, nothing here is ever stale enough to matter and the expiry is never
 * reached. What it covers is an announcement that never came — a dropped
 * request, a hub restarted while a table sat empty — and it decides how long a
 * wrong number can survive, not how fresh a right one is.
