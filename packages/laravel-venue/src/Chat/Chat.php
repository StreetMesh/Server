 * Saying something in a space.

 * that space sees it. A lobby, a table and a party are the same kind of thing —
 * somewhere you can be — so they are the same kind of thing here.
 *
 * Text layers rather than superseding, which is the one place a party behaves
 * differently from how its audio does. You cannot listen to two conversations,
 * so party voice replaces the room's; you can perfectly well read two, and a
 * party member cut off from the room's chat would miss whatever everybody
 * around them is reacting to.
