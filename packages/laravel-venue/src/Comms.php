 * What the comms widget needs to know, in one place.

 * Two surfaces ask for it — the snippet the host page includes, and the
 * documents served into the frames — and they have to agree. They did not for a
 * while: the frames knew which party somebody was in and the page around them
 * did not, which was survivable only while the media lived in a frame.
 *
 * It does not any more. A navigation replaces the page's body and reloads every
 * iframe in it, so anything holding a camera has to live in the one place that
 * survives: the host document. The frames render; this is what the host is told
 * so it can do the rest.
