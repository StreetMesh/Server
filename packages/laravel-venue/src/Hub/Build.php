 * makes one hub different from another is the rooms it serves — and only the
 * server knows which those are, because it is the thing the experiences were
 * installed into. So the server emits it.
 *
 * Flat and self-contained on purpose. Everything is copied in: no submodules,
 * no path repositories, no dependency resolved from a git host at deploy time.
 * A hub built from local rooms and a published copy of everything else is the
 * same trap as a package tested against its own stale vendor directory — it
 * looks right until the two disagree, and then it is somebody else's afternoon.
