/**
 * Browsers talking directly, which needs no infrastructure and no configuration.
 *
 * Every participant connects to every other, so each of them uploads a copy of
 * their stream per peer. That is ideal for two people and hopeless somewhere
 * past four, which is where the party ceiling comes from — and it keeps a venue
 * runnable by one person on one machine, which is the property this
 * architecture keeps having to defend.
 *
 * Deliberately without a configuration block. An early sketch gave it one, for
 * the addresses it uses to get through a router, and those are a property of
 * peer-to-peer rather than a decision an operator makes — a knob nobody has a
 * reason to turn is one more thing to get wrong before anything works at all.
 *
 * A relay is the answer for the pairs this fails, and it is not built. It is a
 * fallback rather than a prerequisite, and when it arrives it is a driver
 * holding one credential rather than configuration every venue must fill in
 * first. Relayed media is billed to the venue, so that venue's cost would scale
 * with conversation; direct media costs it nothing at all, which is the
 * strongest argument for keeping this the default rather than the fallback.
