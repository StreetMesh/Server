/**
 * Who is actually at a party right now, as opposed to who belongs to one.
 *
 * Membership is a fact in the database and outlives everything: it survives a
 * closed laptop, a flat battery and a week away. This is the other question —
 * whose browser is here this second — and it is the only one a handshake can be
 * built on, because you cannot offer a camera to somebody who is not looking.
 *
 * It used to be the realtime half's answer, and that was the wrong place for
 * it. A room hands out an identity of its own and takes it away when the socket
 * drops, so a moment of bad signal read to everybody else as one person leaving
 * and a stranger arriving: every connection torn down and rebuilt, and a
 * reconnection that could kick the very session it was reconnecting. None of
 * that is about who is in the room. It is about the room having opinions on
 * identity, which is the venue's business.
 *
 * So a browser names itself, and this remembers the name for a few seconds at a
 * time. Nothing is issued, so nothing can be taken away; a browser that goes
 * quiet simply stops being mentioned, and one that comes back says the same
 * name it said before and is where it was.
 *
 * It rides on the poll the handshake was already making, which is why adding it
 * costs no request, no socket and nothing to keep alive. See `Mailbox`, whose
 * discipline this follows exactly.
