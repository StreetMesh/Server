 * to learn the other's addresses and what it can decode. That exchange is a few
 * small messages and then it is over for good — after it, the audio and video
 * go straight between the two browsers and this server never sees a frame.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in the room, and that was learned the hard way. It
 * is not gameplay; the room's transport is tuned for small frequent messages
 * and caps one at 4KB, which is fine for a move and about half of what a video
 * offer needs — so enabling a camera closed the socket. The venue already knows
 * who is in which party, which is the only question that needs answering to
 * carry a note.
 *
 * Nothing here is durable. A note not collected within a couple of minutes
 * belongs to a connection nobody is waiting for any more.
