/**
 * Break up parties nobody is in.
 *
 * A party disbands itself when the last person walks out of it, and that covers
 * everybody who leaves by pressing something. It does not cover the ordinary
 * way a visit actually ends: somebody gives their permission back, or it
 * expires, and the delegation their membership was held against goes — taking
 * the membership with it and leaving the party standing with nobody in it.
 *
 * Nothing notices at the time, because nothing was watching. What is left is a
 * name an invitation could still be accepted against, which would put somebody
 * alone in a room they were asked into by people who are no longer here.
 *
 * The hub is not consulted, and does not need to be. Whether anybody is
 * *connected* is its business; whether anybody is still a member is this
 * server's own record, and that is the question being asked.
