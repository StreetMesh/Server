 * Clear away tables nobody came to.

 * Somebody opens a game, waits, and closes the tab. What is left is an
 * invitation nobody can accept — the person who sent it has gone, and anybody
 * arriving at it is joining a game with one player who is not there. Left
 * alone they accumulate, and a lobby of them makes a venue look busy and
 * abandoned at the same time.
 *
 * Only ever a table with one seat. Two people meeting is a game, whether or not
 * a move was played, and a game is somebody's to conclude rather than this
 * command's to delete.
