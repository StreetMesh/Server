 * before deciding to come. An experience answers "what can I do here", which is
 * nobody's business until they have arrived and looked at the menu.
 *
 * Chess was written as a capability first, and it showed: two of the four
 * methods it had to implement returned empty strings, because it had no service
 * type to announce and no front page to greet anybody with. A class that can
 * only half-satisfy an interface is usually implementing the wrong one.
