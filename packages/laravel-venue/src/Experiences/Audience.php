 * because the answer is not even a property of the *kind* of thing. Two games
 * of chess at the same venue may reasonably differ.
 *
 * Deliberately about watching only. Nothing here grants a way to *act*: taking
 * a chair is a separate question with a separate answer, and an audience that
 * could join in would be a permission rather than a privacy setting.
 *
 * Three answers rather than a boolean, because "public" collapses two genuinely
 * different things — a thing anybody may stumble on, and a thing anybody who
 * has arrived may look at. The middle one is what a venue with a members' room
 * needs, and a boolean cannot say it.
