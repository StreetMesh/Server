 * Who is at a party this second, as opposed to who belongs to one.
 *
 * Membership is in the database and survives a week away. This is the other
 * question, and it is the one a handshake needs: there is no point offering a
 * camera to somebody whose laptop is shut.
 *
 * It rides on the poll that was already fetching notes, so asking is also how a
 * browser says it is still here. Nothing is issued to anybody, which is the
 * point — a browser names its own connection, so nothing can be taken away from
 * it and coming back is saying the same name again.
