 * tidiness: a suite that inherited the public PLC directory as a default once
 * published about thirty permanent, global identities for hosts that exist on
 * one laptop. Nothing looked wrong, because the configuration was a URL and a
 * URL that already looks right is not something you go and check.
 *
 * Reads answer "not there", which is the ordinary negative every caller already
 * handles. Writes are accepted and remembered, so a test can ask what would
 * have been sent.
