    The comms widget, included once by whatever draws this venue's chrome.

    The three iframes are in the markup rather than created by script, and that
    is what makes them survive a `wire:navigate`: Livewire replaces the body on
    every navigation, so anything appended to it by hand is gone the first time
    somebody follows a link. `@persist` keeps this subtree across the swap,
    which matters more here than it looks — the stage holds live peer
    connections and a microphone, and re-creating an iframe reloads it.

    The script that arranges them runs in this document and does nothing else —
    see `comms/host.js`.
