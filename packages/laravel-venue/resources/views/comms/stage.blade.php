        A shell, and nothing else.

        There is no script here. The camera, the microphone and the peer
        connections live in the page that holds this frame, because a
        navigation reloads every iframe on it and a stream cannot outlive the
        document that acquired it. What is left here is the stylesheet that
        keeps those faces out of the venue's CSS, and somewhere to put them.

        /*
            No `color-scheme` here, deliberately.

            Declaring one makes the browser paint its own canvas behind the
            document — opaque, and in the theme's colour. These frames are
            transparent so that a circle reads as a circle, and setting
            `color-scheme: dark` put a dark rectangle behind the badge and every
            face. The colours below follow the class the page sets instead.
        */

        /*
            These documents load no stylesheet of their own, which is what keeps
            them fast — and means they get none of the reset the rest of the
            application has. Without this the browser default of `content-box`
            applies: padding is added to a width rather than counted inside it,
            so a container at `height: 100%` with padding below it is taller
            than the frame holding it and hangs its contents out of the bottom.
