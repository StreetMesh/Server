 * space with a broadcast behind it would stop asking a question whose answer is
 * almost always "nothing" — see the note in the decision record.

    the conversation can fill it and keep its composer at the foot. That leaves
    the inset to this — and putting it on the parts rather than the whole is
    what keeps the scrollbar against the panel's edge while the words stay in

        `x-init` runs exactly once per new line, and the two-second poll that
        found nothing says nothing.

        Opened at the end, and kept there.

        A conversation is read from the bottom: the newest line is the one you
        came for, and starting at the top of a long one means scrolling past
        everything you have already seen.

        Three moments need it and they are not the same. The first render, which
        is `x-init`. Anything arriving afterwards, which is the observer — a
        poll morphs new lines in without Alpine being told. And becoming
        visible, which is the tab switch: a hidden pane has no height, so
        whatever it did about scrolling while it was hidden was done to a box
        of nothing.

        `stick` is what keeps that from being rude. Somebody who has scrolled up
        to read is not dragged back down every two seconds; the moment they
        return to the bottom, following resumes.

            One pill, with the way to send it tucked inside.

            A field and a button beside it is two things to look at for one act.
            This is the shape a chat box has settled into everywhere, and it is
            the shape because it reads as a single thing you type into — the
            button is a full stop rather than a second control.

            A textarea rather than an input, so a long message wraps and the

                to what the server last knew and taking the caret with it. The
