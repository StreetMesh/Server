    {{--
        The two conversations, and which one is being read.

        Held in the browser rather than on the server. A tab is UI state, and
        making it a round trip queued every click behind whatever poll was in
        flight — which on Safari read as a long pause or as a click that did
        nothing at all. The server is told afterwards, so that the page stops
        choosing a default once somebody has chosen for themselves, and nothing
        waits for that to land.
    --}}
    {{--
        `wire:ignore`, because Alpine owns what this looks like and Livewire
        must not write over it.

        Which tab is lit is held in the browser — that is the whole point of the
        arrangement, and it is why the panes switch the instant they are tapped.
        But the classes saying so are put on by `x-bind`, and a re-render
        replaces the class attribute with the one the server drew, which has
        none of them. Alpine does not put them back, because from its side
        nothing changed: `tab` is still what it just set.

        Not tapping is no defence. This element polls, so the strip went grey on
        its own every five seconds whether anybody had touched it or not — and a
        tab that is lit, then is not, then is again is worse than one that was
        never lit at all, because it looks like the panel disagreeing with
        itself about where you are.

        So Livewire is told to leave it alone, and the two things in here that do
        change come through `$wire`, which reaches into an ignored subtree
        because it is not the document it is watching.
    --}}
    {{--
        Everything above the row of buttons, and the one place a drawer can
        slide without shoving anything else around.

        `relative`, so the settings can be laid over this rather than beside it,
        and `overflow-hidden` so the part of them that is still off the bottom
        stays off it. Both headers and both conversations live in here; only the
        row of comms buttons is outside, which is why that row does not move
        when the settings arrive.

        {{--
            The conversation half, made unreachable rather than merely hidden
            while the settings are over it.

            `inert` and not `x-show`: something covered is still in the document,
            still focusable and still read aloud, and a tab strip you can reach
            with a keyboard but not see is exactly the confusion this whole
            arrangement exists to end. It also settles the older mistake — the
            faded conversation that was still live — for the same reason and in
            one attribute.

                A circle rather than a bare glyph. The tabs are the thing being
                chosen between; this is one control sitting next to them, and a
                cross floating at whatever size the document happened to be reads
                as debris rather than a button.

                Sized to the row, which is also the smallest target a thumb can be
                asked to find: it was 28px, and on a phone that is a button you
                miss and then miss again. The tabs either side are 44px tall for
                the same reason, so matching them costs no height — the circle
                fills the strip it already sat in the middle of.

                The glyph grows with it. A cross at the old size inside a circle
                this size reads as a mistake rather than as a bigger button.

                Its own centred cell, so the circle lines up with the middle of the
                strip rather than the top of the text.

                Up, because that is the direction the caret in its corner points

                    It used to be a strip that rose over the bottom of the conversation:
                    tabs still lit, chat still there, and the only thing saying which one
                    you were talking to was that one of them was faded. That is a state
                    somebody has to work out rather than see, and the mistake it invited was
                    typing into a conversation that was not listening — so the fade was
                    removed, and then the thing behind was interactive, which was worse.

                    So the panel is either reading or arranging, and says which. The title
                    replaces the tabs and the caret takes the close button's place, at the
                    same size in the same cell — the control in that corner always means
                    "put this back", and what "this" is follows from what the header says.

                    Shutting the panel outright is still one press away, from the button
                    that opened this. Nothing is trapped in here.

        once something is turned on, so before a party existed there was no
        switch anywhere on screen and no way in at all. The tab is present
        whenever parties are offered, so keying on it keeps them reachable
        while still not putting a microphone under a text conversation.

        Icons alone. The state is the variant — lit when live — and the word
        underneath was saying a second time what the colour already said, in a
        strip only wide enough for two buttons.

            glancing at their own microphone cannot afford to get wrong.

            Both weights are drawn and one is hidden, the same way the party
            drawer's caret is — `flux:button`'s own `icon` is resolved when the
            page is built and cannot follow a state the browser is holding. The
            outlined one carries no `x-cloak` because off is where these start,
