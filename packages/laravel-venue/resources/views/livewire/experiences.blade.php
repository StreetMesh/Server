                        Two ways in, where an experience offers them.

                        The primary one asks something: taking part means
                        arriving with a name another server issued. The second
                        asks nothing, because looking should not cost what
                        playing costs — a stranger wanting to see what is on met
                        a form asking them to name their own server first, which
                        is a toll nobody pays to look at a chessboard.
