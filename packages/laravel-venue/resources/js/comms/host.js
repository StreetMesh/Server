/**
 * The comms widget, and everything it is holding.
 *
 * This runs in the host document, and that is the whole point of it. A
 * navigation replaces the page's body and reloads every iframe in it — an
 * iframe reloads whenever it is moved in the DOM, which is what preserving one
 * across a swap amounts to — so nothing that must survive a navigation can live
 * inside a frame. The top-level document is the one context that does survive.
 *
 * So the camera, the microphone and the peer connections live here, and the
 * frames are views over them:
 *
 *   badge   the circle in the corner
 *   panel   what opens when it is pressed — chat, parties, the switches
 *   stage   the row of faces, drawn into by this document
 *
 * The frames are still frames because that is what keeps a venue's screens and
 * this widget out of each other's stylesheets and stacking contexts. They just
 * no longer own anything: the stage is a shell this writes into, which it may
 * do because they are the same origin. Streams cannot be posted between
 * documents — a MediaStream is not structured-cloneable — but they can be
 * handed straight to an element in a document you can reach.
