 * A party is people talking, which is the host's business — the realtime half
 * is for the rules of an experience and the state a room has to agree on, and a
 * party has neither. It used to answer this, and issuing an identity of its own
 * meant a moment of bad signal read to everybody else as one person leaving and
 * a stranger arriving.
 *
 * So this browser names its own connection. Nothing is issued to it, so nothing
 * can be withdrawn; going quiet stops it being mentioned, and coming back is
 * saying the same name again.
 *
 * Framework-free, and that is deliberate rather than austere. This holds a
 * microphone and a set of peer connections that have to outlive every re-render
 * happening around them, and the surest way to guarantee that is to owe nothing
 * to whatever is doing the rendering.
 *
 * It draws nothing. What it does is call back when something changes, and the
 * thing that draws decides what that looks like.
