{{--
    Choosing a face.

    A settings screen rather than one of this package's own, which is why it
    wears the host's settings chrome: `@include('partials.settings-heading')`
    and `<x-pages::settings.layout>` both belong to the application. That is the
    same arrangement every other screen here already has — this package ships
    screens written against the Livewire starter kit's layout, and a package
    that framed its own would look like a different site one click in.

    The point of the copy is the sentence under the heading: this is not a
    setting on this server. It is a thing published at the resident's own
    address, which is why anywhere they go can show it without asking here.
