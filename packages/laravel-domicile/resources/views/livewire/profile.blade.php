    a browser is asking about a person, and gets sent here.

            This is the other half of what serving an avatar from a resident's
            own address buys: somebody who has met "collegeman" somewhere else
            can come here and see whether that is what collegeman looks like.
            A picture anybody could have set on any server would prove nothing;
            this one is served by the only server that answers for the name.
