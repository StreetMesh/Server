/**
 * What somebody looks like, at their own address.
 *
 * `collegeman.stme.sh/avatar/icon` is a resident's face, served by the server
 * that answers for their name and by nothing else. That is the whole of the
 * design: not a signature, not a document asserting where a picture lives, but
 * an address only one party can answer for. A venue drawing this has fetched it
 * from the person's own server, which is a stronger thing to be able to say
 * than that somebody signed a copy.
 *
 * Which resident is decided by the hostname, exactly as it is for the identity
 * documents alongside — a resident's handle is a name under this server's own,
 * so the same paths serve many people and the host is what tells them apart.
 *
 * Deliberately unauthenticated, and outside the `web` group. Both matter. A
 * venue asking has no session here and never will; and `SendResidentsHome`
 * redirects every browser route on a resident hostname to their profile, so a
 * route registered in `web` would be answered with a permanent redirect and
 * never run at all.
