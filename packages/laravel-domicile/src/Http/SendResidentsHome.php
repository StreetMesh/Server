 * A person who typed a resident's address into a browser.
 *
 * `collegeman.stme.sh` is a hostname, and a hostname exists so that a machine
 * resolving a handle can find `/.well-known/atproto-did`. It was never meant to
 * be browsed. Somebody who types it in is not resolving anything — they are
 * asking about a person — so they are sent to that person's page.
 *
 * Only on browser routes. Handle resolution and everything else a stranger's
 * server asks for is registered outside the `web` group, so none of it passes
 * through here: a redirect on `.well-known/atproto-did` would break the one
 * thing the subdomain exists for.
