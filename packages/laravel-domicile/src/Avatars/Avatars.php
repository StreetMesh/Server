/**
 * Somebody deciding what they look like.
 *
 * An avatar is a thing a person asserts about themselves, which is what makes
 * it a different shape from everything else this server keeps. A chess result
 * is something that *happened to* somebody, and a venue signs it because the
 * venue is the only party in a position to say — that is an attestation, and
 * the record wraps one. Nobody attests to a face. There is no third party who
 * could, and a signature over one would be a signature over an opinion.
 *
 * So this writes a record with nothing nested inside it: the resident's own
 * key, over their own claim, in their own store. It is the first record here of
 * that kind and it will not be the last.
 *
 * What makes it checkable is not a signature but an address. Only the server
 * answering for `collegeman.stme.sh` can put a picture at
 * `collegeman.stme.sh/avatar/icon`, which is the same reason a published mark
 * is evidence about a venue rather than a claim about one.
