 * whole purpose of this class. These bytes come back from a resident's own
 * hostname — the same origin that answers for their identity — so serving a
 * stranger's file back unaltered from that address is not something to do
 * carefully. It is something not to do.
 *
 * Re-encoding settles four things at once. Whatever was uploaded is now
 * demonstrably an image, because it survived being decoded. Its EXIF is gone,
 * including the location the camera recorded. Its dimensions are ours. And an
 * SVG full of script, or a PNG with a payload after the image data, does not
 * survive the round trip at all.
 *
 * Square, because every place that draws one draws it in a circle, and a
 * picture cropped by CSS is cropped differently in each of them.
