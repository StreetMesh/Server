 * What somebody looks like before they have said.
 *
 * A domicile always answers for its own residents. Somebody who has published
 * nothing still has a name, and their first letter on a ground of their own is
 * more than nothing — so this is what `/avatar/icon` serves until there is a
 * picture, rather than a refusal that every caller has to know how to handle.
 *
 * Deliberately a letter and deliberately not a silhouette. A generic figure
 * says only "a person", which the caller already knew; a letter says which
 * person, and everywhere that stands in for a face today is already drawing
 * exactly that. Answering with less than the thing being replaced would make
 * every caller worse off for having asked.
 *
 * The colour is derived from the whole handle rather than chosen, so it is
 * stable for as long as the name is and two residents of one server are
 * unlikely to share it. That makes a letter a weak kind of recognition —
 * enough to tell four people apart in a row of circles, and nothing anybody
 * should be asked to authenticate on.
 *
 * SVG because it is a few hundred bytes and scales to any circle. That it is
 * also a document format is the reason for the headers on the response: these
 * bytes come back from the origin that answers for somebody's identity.
