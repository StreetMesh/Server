/**
 * Bringing identities into being.
 *
 * Two methods, and the choice is consequential rather than cosmetic. `did:web`
 * needs nothing but a hostname you already control, which makes it right for
 * development and for a server content to be found where it lives. `did:plc`
 * costs a public entry in a directory and buys two things `did:web` cannot
 * offer at all: an identifier that survives its subject moving, and a dated
 * history of keys so that something signed years ago can still be checked.
 *
 * Minting a `did:plc` publishes to shared infrastructure and cannot be undone,
 * so it is never a side effect of anything here — it is asked for explicitly.
