/**
 * Turning an identifier into a key you can check a signature with.
 *
 * Two methods are supported, and they are not equivalent. `did:plc` derives its
 * identifier from a signed genesis operation and keeps every later operation in
 * a public log, so it can answer both "which key now" and "which key then".
 * `did:web` derives its identifier from a location and publishes a document, so
 * it can only answer the first — and an identifier that is a location also stops
 * being true when its subject moves.
 *
 * Both are here because both exist on the network. Which one an identity uses is
 * its own business; what a verifier must not do is treat the two answers as the
 * same kind of answer, which is what VerificationKey is for.
