/**
 * A permission slip to sit somewhere, for the realtime half of this server.
 *
 * Everything hard has already happened here: a federated address was resolved,
 * a delegation was checked, somebody was seated. The realtime half can do none
 * of that and should never learn how — so it is told the answer, signed with
 * the key this server already publishes, and has only a signature to check.
 *
 * Here rather than in the venue package, though only a venue mints one, because
 * a ticket is a format two independent implementations have to agree on
 * exactly: PHP signs it and TypeScript checks it, across base58, a multicodec
 * prefix, a compressed curve point and a raw signature pair. Anything two
 * implementations must agree about is protocol. Deciding *who* may sit where
 * remains the venue's business entirely.
 *
 * That is what keeps the join path free of shared secrets. The realtime process
 * holds no credential, cannot impersonate this server, and cannot assert
 * anything back: everything it knows arrived signed by somebody else.
 *
 * Short-lived on purpose. A ticket is good for long enough to open a websocket
 * and not long enough to be worth stealing — and because it names one room, a
 * stolen one opens one door rather than the building.

     * subject as the same person returning — one shared identifier would have
