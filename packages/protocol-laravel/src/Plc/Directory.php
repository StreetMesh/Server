/**
 * A PLC directory, kept by this server.
 *
 * The public one at plc.directory is a small Node service and a database, and
 * for development that is a container, a compose file and a daemon somebody has
 * to remember to start — a Docker dependency bolted to a Laravel application
 * for the sake of four endpoints. This is those four endpoints.
 *
 * It is deliberately not a reimplementation of anybody's product. What a
 * directory is trusted for is narrow and is the whole reason depending on one
 * is acceptable at all: a DID is derived from a signed genesis operation, and
 * every operation after it must be signed by a key the subject holds and must
 * name the operation it was written against. So a directory cannot forge an
 * identity, invent one, or reassign one. It can only decline to answer.
 *
 * That is the property being preserved here, and it is why this can be short.
 * Everything a directory actually does is: check a signature, check a chain,
 * and remember. The DID document is derived on every read rather than stored,
 * because a stored one is a second copy of something the log already says.
 *
 * **Use the real directory in production.** This exists so that a developer
 * needs Postgres-free, Docker-free, one-command local identities — not so that
 * anybody runs their own registry in earnest. Entries here are as permanent as
 * this server's database and resolvable by nobody else.

     * somebody recovers an identity from a server that has gone bad. Nothing
     * here does that: a conflicting operation is refused rather than allowed to
     * fork.
     *
     * That is the right trade for a development directory and the wrong one for
     * a real registry, and it is written here rather than discovered because a
     * missing recovery path is invisible until the day it is the only thing
