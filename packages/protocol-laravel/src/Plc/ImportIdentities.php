/**
 * Bring identities in from another directory.
 *
 * Written for one afternoon in particular — moving off a directory that ran in
 * Docker and onto the one this server keeps itself — but it is not only for
 * that. Mirroring a real identity locally is the same operation, and so is
 * standing a second development machine up with the same residents on it.
 *
 * Every operation is replayed through `Directory::submit` rather than copied
 * into the table, which is the point rather than caution. An import that
 * succeeds has re-derived each identifier from its genesis, re-checked every
 * signature, and re-linked every `prev` — so it is also the strongest available
 * check that our reading of the method agrees with the software the real
 * directory runs. An import that fails has found a disagreement, and that is
 * worth knowing on an afternoon rather than on a Friday.
