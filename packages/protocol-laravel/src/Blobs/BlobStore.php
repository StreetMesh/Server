/**
 * Putting bytes in, and getting them back out.
 *
 * The only way to write a blob, and arranged like `RecordStore` so that the
 * things which make it trustworthy cannot be skipped by accident: the name is
 * computed rather than supplied, and the type is looked at rather than
 * accepted. A caller cannot get either wrong, because a caller does not get to
 * say.
 *
 * The type matters more here than it looks. These bytes are served back from a
 * resident's own hostname, which is the same origin their identity documents
 * are answered from — so an uploader who could choose the content type could
 * serve a script from an address the rest of the network trusts. Sniffing is
 * not politeness about file extensions; it is the whole of what stops that.
