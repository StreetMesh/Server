 * A file somebody holds, named by what is in it.

 * disk, at a path this derives. That split is deliberate — a picture belongs in
 * object storage where an operator can put a CDN in front of it, and a database
 * that holds megabytes of image is a database that cannot be backed up quickly.
 *
 * Like a record, a blob is written once. Unlike a record, the reason is not
 * about citation but about arithmetic: the name *is* the content, so a blob
 * whose bytes changed would simply be a different blob under a name that no
 * longer described it.
