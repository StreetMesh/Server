/**
 * One thing that happened to somebody, as they hold it.
 *
 * Written once and never again. That is not caution — it is what makes a
 * reference to a record mean anything. If a record could change after being
 * cited, then "the game recorded at this address" would name whatever is there
 * now rather than what was there then, and every signature over it, every
 * dispute about it and every copy of it elsewhere would drift apart silently.
 *
 * A correction is therefore a new record that says what it corrects, and the
 * old one stays. History accumulates rather than being edited, which is also
 * the only version of history a second party can check.
 *
 * @property int $id
 * @property string $did
