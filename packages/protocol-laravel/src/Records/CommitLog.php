 * Every change to somebody's records, signed and in order.
 *
 * A record on its own says only that it has not been altered since it was named.
 * The chain is what says the person it belongs to committed to it, and that the
 * set is the one they committed to rather than one their server assembled.
 *
 * Worth repeating where it will be read: this does not stop a server lying about
 * its residents, because the server holds the key. It makes lying leave a mark.
 * A substituted past produces a link that does not fit, so anybody who saw the
 * earlier link — another server, a visitor, the resident's own backup — can show
 * the two histories disagree.
