 * player holds that statement on their own server. It is worth holding because
 * it can be checked by anybody, later, with nothing but the document and public
 * infrastructure — not because the venue is still around to be asked, and not
 * because the server holding it is trusted.
 *
 * This object only exists for statements that have already verified. There is no
 * way to construct an unverified one, so anything with an Attestation in hand is
 * holding something that checked out rather than something that arrived.
