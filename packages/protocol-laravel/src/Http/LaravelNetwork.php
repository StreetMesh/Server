/**
 * The way out, using the application's own HTTP client.
 *
 * This is the binding the package exists for. The framework-free layer defines
 * what it needs from the network in two methods and ships a plain cURL
 * implementation so it works alone; here that is replaced by something with the
 * host's timeouts, its retries, its logging, and — the part that matters most —
 * its cache.
 *
 * Identity documents are fetched constantly and change rarely, so caching them
 * is the difference between resolving a handle costing nothing and costing a
 * round trip to somebody else's server on every page load. The interval is
 * short because a DID document is how a key rotation becomes visible, and a
 * stale one is a key that was retired an hour ago and is still being trusted.
