/**
 * Somebody else writing a record into a resident's own store.
 *
 * The end of the whole exercise. A venue asked, a resident agreed, and this is
 * where that agreement is spent — the venue writes the finished game into the
 * player's records, on the player's server, and then has nothing further to do
 * with it. The record is not the venue's copy of what happened; it is the
 * player's, and it outlives the venue.
 *
 * Three things are checked and none of them is "is this venue trustworthy":
 * whether the token is live, whether the key presenting it is the key it was
 * issued to, and whether what was granted covers what is being attempted.
