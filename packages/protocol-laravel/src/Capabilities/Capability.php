 * The awkward consequence, and the reason this exists: two capabilities
 * installed side by side both want the front page, both want to be in the
 * navigation, and both want to say what this server is. None of that can be
 * settled by either of them, because neither outranks the other. So each
 * declares what it provides and the application decides where it goes.
