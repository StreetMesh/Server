/**
 * A capability's own mark, in the two grounds it needs.
 *
 * Named rather than listed. A mark that carries its own ground needs a second
 * drawing for a dark surface — the ground goes transparent so the page shows
 * through — and every pack built for this server is built the same way: one
 * base name, `-small` and `-dark-small` beside it. So an operator names the
 * pair and the convention supplies the rest, instead of writing two paths that
 * can disagree with each other.
 *
 * The small variants, because every caller here draws this between 32 and 48
 * pixels. Below 32 the packs ship a micro variant, and nothing in this
 * application is small enough to want one yet.
 *
 * Why a capability has one at all: a server can be a domicile and a venue at
 * once, and those are two things to be rather than one thing wearing two
 * hats. Somebody arriving at the venue half of this server is at Tabletop; the
 * same server answering for a resident's records is StreetMesh. One mark for
 * the application could only ever be right about one of them.
