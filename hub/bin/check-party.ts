/**
 * Check that a table can see who is in a party.
 *
 *   ./check-party
 *
 * A party is not a room here any more and the hub knows nothing about how one
 * works — who is in it, and the handshake that gets them talking, are the
 * venue's, carried over ordinary HTTP. What is left for this process is the one
 * thing that has to be true in a *room*: that a table can see somebody is in a
 * party.
 *
 * That is the whole of what stops a party being a hidden channel. Somebody in
 * one has their voice superseded by it, which leaves them present at the table
 * and unhearable there; a table that could not show it would be a table where
 * people talk to a wall and cannot tell why. A venue that allows a private
 * channel has not thereby decided to hide it.
 *
 * The claim rides on the ticket the venue already signs for the table, so none
 * of this depends on a party being anything the hub can reach.
 *
 * Every ticket here is minted by the venue in PHP, exactly as check-join's are.
