 * connects real websocket clients to it, and checks that the door behaves — the
 * difference being that a signature check can be perfect while the room admits
 * everybody anyway, and only one of those two things is what actually keeps
 * strangers out.
 *
 * Every ticket here is minted by the venue in PHP. Nothing is faked but the
 * room's contents, because the room has none yet.
